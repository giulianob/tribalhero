0_FIGHTER_PLURAL_UNIT,Fighters
0_FIGHTER_UNIT_DESC,"Fighter is a basic unit that can do average damage to most other units. On top of that, fighter health is high enough for them to hold off much damage and protect the weaker units behind them. Fighter is one of the few units that is good against Cannon Tower and Catapult but can fall to bow units if they receive no help. Fighter also carries average amount of loot from the battle which makes up for their lack of damage."

0_BOWMAN_PLURAL_UNIT,Bowmen
0_BOWMAN_UNIT_DESC,"Bowman is strong against all except machine units, structures, and their damage splashes among multiple targets; however they have relatively low health compare to the damage they deal. It is wise to protect them with other units. When using bowmen, be very careful of enemy units with high range (such as Cavalry, Knight) as they can hit the Bowmen from the beginning of the battle."

It is wise to protect them with other units. When using Archer, be very careful of enemy unit with high range (such as Cavalry, Knight) they can reach Archer from the beginning of the battle."
1_PIKEMAN_UNIT,Hoplite
1_PIKEMAN_PLURAL_UNIT,Hoplites
1_PIKEMAN_UNIT_DESC,Hoplite is a very special trained unit to take down mounted units such as Cavalry and Knight. They are not very well equiped against anyone else so do not expect to win a battle with just Hoplites.
1_GLADIATOR_UNIT,Gladiator
1_GLADIATOR_PLURAL_UNIT,Gladiators
1_GLADIATOR_UNIT_DESC,"Gladiator, the fearless warrior is the one of the good siege units in a tribe. They are very good against Helepolis and Tower. Their quickness allow them to reach enemies deep in the formation; and with decent damage, none can hold long before they are beheaded."
1_CAVALRY_UNIT,Cavalry
1_CAVALRY_PLURAL_UNIT,Cavalries
1_CAVALRY_UNIT_DESC,"This unit is very strong against Bowmen and Archers, as they can slice into second row in the very beginning; however, they are very fragile relatively to other unit. Their lack of armor is hard to justify without looking into their speed. Cavalry is the fastest unit and provides a speed boost to the overall troop."
1_HEAVY_CAVALRY_UNIT,Knight
1_HEAVY_CAVALRY_PLURAL_UNIT,Knights
1_HEAVY_CAVALRY_UNIT_DESC,"An all-around unit which does not deal a whole lot of damage and has high upkeep, but most importantly, they hang around as long as they can to protect other units that are behind them. They are the meatshield in case the first row is destroyed. Knight is very strong against Cannon Tower, slightly weak against Hoplite and Helepolis."

1_CATAPULT_UNIT,Catapult
1_CATAPULT_PLURAL_UNIT,Catapults
1_CATAPULT_UNIT_DESC,"The only unit that does meaningful damage to structures. Catapults are also strong against machines but can fall quickly to any melee units. Beware when Catapult is sent with the troops, overall movement will be lowered to have the same speed as the Catapult regardless of the troop's composition."

1_OXWAGON_PLURAL_UNIT,Ox Wagons
1_OXWAGON_UNIT_DESC,A non-combat unit used to carry loot. The oxen are fed with beer; its fat is quite thick so some tribes use them as shields.

0_FIGHTER_UNIT_DESC,"Fighter is a basic unit that can do average damage to most units.  On top of that, fighter health is high enough for them to hold off much damage and protect the weaker units behind them.  Fighter is one of the few units that is good against cannon tower and catapult, but can fall to bow units if they receive no help.  Fighter also carries average amount of loot from the battle which makes up for their lack of damage."

0_BOWMAN_UNIT_DESC,"Bowman is strong against all except machine units and structures and their damage splashes among multiple targets; however they have relatively low health compare to the damage that they deal.  It is wise to protect them with other units.  When using bowmen, be very careful of enemy unit with high range (such as Cavalry, Knight) they can reach bowman from the beginning."

1_PIKEMAN_PLURAL_UNIT,Hoplites
1_PIKEMAN_UNIT_DESC,"Hoplite is a very special trained unit  to take down mounted units such as Cavalry and Knight.  They are not very well equiped against anyone else, so do not expect to win a battle with just Hoplites."

1_GLADIATOR_PLURAL_UNIT,Gladiators
1_GLADIATOR_UNIT_DESC,"Gladiator, the fearless warrior is the one of the good siege units in a tribe.   They are very good against Helepolis and Tower.  Their quickness allow them to reach enemies deep in the formation; and with decent damage, none can hold long before they are beheaded.  Enemies would have to pile up Bowmen and Archers and pray.  "
1_CAVALRY_UNIT,Cavalry
1_CAVALRY_PLURAL_UNIT,Cavalries
1_CAVALRY_UNIT_DESC,"This unit is very strong against Bowmen and Archers, as they can slice into second row in the very beginning; however, they are very fragile relatively to other unit.  Their lack of armor is hard to justify without looking into their speed.  Cavalry easily the fastest unit in the world, and provides speed boost to the overall troop."

1_HEAVY_CAVALRY_UNIT_DESC,"An all-around unit who does not deal whole lot of damage and high upkeep, but most importanlty, they hang around as long as they could to protect what's behind them.  They are the meatshield in case of the first row is destroyed.   Knight is very strong against Cannon Tower, slightly weak against Hoplite and Helepolis.  Beware when Helepolis is sent with the troops, overall movement will be lowered to have the same speed as the Helepolis regardless of the troop composition."
